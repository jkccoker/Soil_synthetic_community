Code for processing sequencing files and producing sequencing figures. FASTQ files can be found on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, project ________.

All 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data was processed using the commands provided in qiime_code.txt.
All shotgun metagenomics sequecing data was processed using the commands provided in shotgun_metagenomics_code.txt. After alignment using bowtie2 (v2.2.3), shotgun metagenomics data was processed further using the R package Phyloseq. Code for this and other Phyloseq figures is provided in the Jupyter notebooks.
